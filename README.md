Over the years, I have developed many bad habits. One of them is lean on my left side while sitting down. This has resulted in shoulder pain that has taken months to heal. 

Because I assume, I am far from being the only one with such bad habits, I have written a short CircuitPython script using VS Code CircuitPython extension inspired by Adafruit Carter Nelson's slouch detector to help prevent such injuries from happening.

This code is portable to any device supporting CircuitPython (see list here)

The Circuit Playground Express (CPX) is a micro-controller, with several embedded sensors including an integrated accelerometer which calculates the angle of inclination and beeps when the threshold is triggered. 

The angle can be adjusted based on the user's application. The script is portable to any microcontroller supporting circuitpython and is simple enough that it can easily be converted to lower level languages.

I have left in the comment section a link to the github repository for anyone to use and repurpose.

I hope many of you find this useful and look forward to hearing about your experience with your own version.
